everything that this is and will become is most likely to be very beginner and boring to most people. 
to me this is something to learn and hopeful be proud of one day. or not idk
made the repo to document my progress. not sure why i made it public tho lol.

current features
- rename a member (doesnt work if a space is used.)
- basic ping command.

wanted/planned features
- ping randomly displays a message from a list of possible responses.
- rename actually doesnt requeire the name to be one word.
